# Analysis of COVID-19 situation in Mexico

Mexican authorities hold news conferences every day to provide updates on the number of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country. Some of the authorities in charge of the conferences are Dr. Hugo López Gatell, the Vice Minister of Prevention and Health Promotion, and Dr. José Luis Alomía Zegarra, the general director of Epidemiology.

All the information are available at the [official website of the Government of Mexico](https://datos.gob.mx/busca/dataset/informacion-referente-a-casos-covid-19-en-mexico)

In this project, I provide a graphical analysis of mexican situation at 14/11/2020 while providing some curious results such as days between been positive in COVID-19 and die. In order to extract as much information as possible, I also create a prediction model based on Machine Learning Algorithms to check the probability of dying if you are COVID-19 confirmed.
